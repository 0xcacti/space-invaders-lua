# space-invaders-lua

Building a Space Invaders game in Lua using the Love2D framework.
Previously wanted to build this in rust, but then I realized 
that I despise rust, and I don't want to use it for anything.  
I enjoy using Lua for neovim, so I decided that I would do some 
cool stuff with it to build a game outside of the context of neovim.
